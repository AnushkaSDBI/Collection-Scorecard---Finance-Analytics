# Collection-Scorecard---Finance-Analytics
This type of scorecard is also used for identifying the bank's most valuable customers. This is used to predict customers' responses to different strategies for collecting owed money. It determines willingness to pay back a loan after defaulting. We usually use logistic regression to predict client's default probability.
Collection score estimates the probability of a debtor making payments for those accounts in collections.
